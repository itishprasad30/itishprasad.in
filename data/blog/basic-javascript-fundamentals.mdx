## How JavaScript Works & Execution Context ?

<aside>
ðŸ“¢ Everything In JavaScript happens inside the Execution Context.

</aside>

Execution Context is a box which consist of two table

variable Environment Thread of Execution

| Memory     | Code        |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| key: value | â€”â€”- 0â€”â€”, â€”- |

- memory part also called as variable env,where it stores the variable,function etc
- Code part where all codes are runs line by line at a time.

<aside>
ðŸ“Œ Javascript Is  **Synchronous-Single-threaded** language.

## How JavaScript Code is executed? and CallStack?

What is a browser JavaScript engine?

A JavaScript engine isÂ **a software component that executes JavaScript code**.

[ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript)
Â is the standardized specification of JavaScript,Â **ECMAScript engine**
Â is another name for these engines.

Which Engine used by most popular browser ?

Google chrome â†’ V8

firefox â†’ spidermonkey

safari â†’ **javascript core** apple engine

Chakra â†’ internet Explore

```jsx
var n = 2;
function square(num) {
  var ans = num * num;
  return ans;
}

var square2 = square(n);
var square = square(4);
```

When the code runs Global Execution context is created:

it has two-part

- Memory allocated phase
- Code creation phase

â†’ 1st Phase

memory allocating to all variables and functions

![phase 1 ](https://res.cloudinary.com/itish22/image/upload/v1648826304/itishprasad/blogImage/Untitled_3_cqfbed.png)

2nd phase â†’

code execution phase

![phase 2](https://res.cloudinary.com/itish22/image/upload/v1648826406/itishprasad/blogImage/Untitled_4_b8isdn.png)

when a function is invocation happens

it will create a new execution context

- memory
- code

![code](https://res.cloudinary.com/itish22/image/upload/v1648826631/itishprasad/blogImage/Untitled_5_xmx3za.png)

then again new function invocation another exhicution context is created

The whole thing managed by Stack is called Callstack

GEC â†’ Global Execution Context

Ec1 â†’ function is invoked and one execution context is created

after it complete the job it popped out

Ec2 â†’ it will push into the call stack

after it done it gets popped out

at last call, stack will be empty

![Untitled](https://res.cloudinary.com/itish22/image/upload/v1648826610/itishprasad/blogImage/Untitled_8_bdokxw.png)

> callstack maintains the order of the execution of execution context

So call stack is also known as :

- Execution context stack
- program stack
- control stack
- runtime stack
- machine stack

## Hosting In Javascript ? [variables and functions ]

Hosting is the Phenomenon in javascript by which we can access the variable and function even before we initialized it.

we can access it without any error.

```jsx
getName(); // javascript basic
console.log(x); // undefined

console.log(getName); // prints the actual code

var x = 13;

function getName() {
  console.log("Javascript basic");
}
```

```jsx
getName(); // javascript basic
console.log(x); // undefined

console.log(getName); // prints the actual code
// getName2(); // error is not a funtion
getName3(); // error is not a funtion
var x = 13;

function getName() {
  console.log("Javascript basic");
}

var getName2 = () => {
  console.log("arrow funtion ");
};

var getName3 = function () {
  console.log("funtion another way to defined");
};
```

on the memory allocation phase getName2 and getName3 will allocate as **undefined so the function is not invoked.**

## How function works in Javascript and variable environment?

```jsx
var x = 1;

a(); // 10
b(); // 100
console.log(x); // 1

function a() {
  var x = 10;
  console.log(x);
}
function b() {
  var x = 100;
  console.log(x);
}
```

## Shortest Javascript Program & Window and This keyword ...

### Window

so in javascript, the window is a Global object is created along with the Global execution context.

also, this variable is created. which is refers to the window object.

```jsx
window === this; // true
```

```jsx
var a = 33;
function sbs() {
  var d = 88;
  console.log(d);
}

console.log(window.a); //10 this is global object
//  console.log(d);// error
console.log(this.a); // 10
// every thing inside this is global obj but inside function is local
```

## What is Undefined and not defined?

**undefined** â†’ just like a placeholder to any variable

- when the program runs js engine allocates all variable in memory allocation phase.

  all as undefined.

```jsx
console.log(a); // undefined
var a;
```

**not defined â†’** if it is not defined in the program then an error will give

which has not been allocated memory

```jsx
console.log(d); // error not defined
```
