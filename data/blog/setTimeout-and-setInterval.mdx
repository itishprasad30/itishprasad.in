# **Javascript Scheduling: setTimeout and setInterval**

A block of JavaScript code is generally executed synchronously. But there are some JavaScript native functions (**_timers_**) which allow us to delay the execution of arbitrary instructions.

- `[setTimeout()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setTimeout)`
- `[setInterval()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setInterval)`

These let you run a piece of JavaScript code at some point in the future. That’s called “**scheduling a call**”. In this tutorial I’ll explain how these two methods work, and give some practical examples.

# **`setTimeout()`**

The `setTimeout()` function is commonly used if you wish to run your function a specified number of milliseconds from when the `setTimeout()` method was called. The general syntax of the method is:

```js
setTimeout(expression, timeout);
```

where `expression` is the JavaScript code to run after `timeout` milliseconds have elapsed.

> To track the timeout, setTimeout() also returns a numeric timeout ID. This is most commonly used with the clearTimeout() method.

Here’s a simple example:

```html
<input
  type="button"
  name="sayHello"
  value="Wait for my Hello!"
  onclick="setTimeout('alert(\'Hello!\')', 4000)"
/>
```

When you click the button, the `setTimeout()` method is called. The expression that you want to run after certain time delay and the time delay itself(4,000 ms or 4 seconds) is passed.

A point to note here is that `setTimeout()` doesn't stop the execution of the further script during the timeout period. It merely schedules the specified javascript code to be run at the specified time. After calling the `setTimeout()` function, the script continues normally, with the timer running in the background.

Above is the very basic example with the entire code for our JavaScript alert box in the `setTimeout()` call. You would instead call a function more often. Next example will give you a better idea about calling a function with `setTimeout()`.

For instance, below code calls `sayHello()` after one second:

```js
function sayHello() {
  alert("Hello");
}
setTimeout(sayHello, 1000);
```

You can also pass arguments along with the function, like this:

```js
function sayHello(message, person) {
  alert(message + ", " + person);
}
setTimeout(sayHello, 1000, "Hi", "Monica"); // Hi, Monica
```

If the first argument is a string, then JavaScript creates a function from it. So, this will also work:

```js
setTimeout("alert('Hello')", 1000);
```

But using strings is not recommended, use functions instead of them, like this:

```js
setTimeout(() => alert("Hello"), 1000);
```

# **`setInterval()`**

The `setInterval()` function, as the name suggests is commonly used to set a delay for functions that are executed again and again like animations. The `setInterval()` function is very closely related to `setTimeout()` - they even have same syntax:

```js
setInterval(expression, interval);
```

The only difference is ,

> setTimeout() triggers the expression only once whilesetInterval() keeps triggering expressionregularly after the given interval of time. (unless you tell it to stop).

To stop further calls, we should call `[clearInterval(timerId](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/clearInterval))`.

```js
// Hello is alerted repeatedly after every 3 seconds
let timerId = setInterval(() => alert("Hello"), 3000);

// Clear intervals after 6 sec with the timer id
setTimeout(() => {
  clearInterval(timerId);
  alert("Bye");
}, 6000);
```

When should I use `setInterval()`? Well, you don’t need to keep remembering to call `setTimeout()` at the end of your timed function. Also, when using `setInterval()` there's virtually no delay between one triggering of the expression and the next. With `setTimeout()`, there's a relatively long delay while the expression is evaluated, the function called, and the new `setTimeout()` being set up. So if regular, precise timing is needed or something needs to be done repeatedly after certain time intervals, then `setInterval()` is your best choice.
